Requirement Specification:

1.A software program that takes an array of periodic current samples from a charging session as input and outputs the number of readings in each range.
2.The program shall be detect the ranges and provide the number of readings in each range.

Test Specification

1.Test the program to verify if it can identify the different ranges of readings and provide the number of readings in each range.
2.Test the program to verify if it can handle a case where all readings belong to the same range.
3.Test the program to verify if it can handle overlapping ranges and provide correct results.
4.Test the program to verify if it can handle a case where readings are evenly spaced and belong to the same range.
5.Test the program to verify if it can handle a case where readings belong to multiple ranges and have a mixture of large and small values
6.Test the program to verify if it can handle a case where readings belong to multiple ranges and have duplicate values.
